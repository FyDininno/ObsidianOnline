Hello, I am Frank Dininno. 
$\quad$ I am a physics enthusiast, and an inventor. As of now, I read books about electrodynamics, and I am in a lab where I am responsible for simulating standing electromagnetic waves in different materials. I like take courses in UCSD which are not required for my major. For instance, Fiber Optics and Organic Chemistry are two of the classes which are less related to my major, nanoengineering. But, I am not worried because although these classes have been rumored to be difficult, I do them out of passion and curiosity, and one day I hope to use them to make the world a better place. To a good day,
 ~ Frank
