1-25 Complaints About UCSD
1. I do not have enough room in off-campus housing to store all of the food that I cook in containers
	1. Buy tupperware.
2. My off campus dining food doesn't taste like anything
	1. Add seasoning and olive oil.
3. I don't know whether this girl I met in dance class has chemistry with me.
	1. Go on more dates with her.
4. It seems like my current UCSD schedule will barely accommodate all of the things I want to do.
	1. Give up part of your life. In this case, I choose sleep.
5. The elevator light to the HSS does not work.
	1. Take the stairs
6. The textbooks they recommend at this school are so terrible (other than ECE).
	1. Get ChatGPT's opinion instead
7. It seems like you can't sit down in a single cozy place on this campus (excluding the one I am at right now)
	1. Put on some music on your earbuds so you can ignore your other senses and get your work done.
8. Rimac seems to be too far away from everywhere important and there are too many people there.
	1. Go to the outdoor gym
9. It seems like every time I go to the outdoor gym, there are gym classes going on, so they won't let me in
	1. Check the outdoor gym schedule
10. It seems like they class schedules align precisely with when they get off class.
	1. It's time to do pullups and pushups with a backpack on.
11.  The administration is trying to screw the nanoengineering department over by cutting funding and restricting class sizes.
	1. Make the classes more rigorous and take on more ambitions projects. When news coverage comes, expose the administration for their transgressions.
12. Freshman and Sophomores have no friends
	1. The school should encourage Sororities and Fraternities (and the sailing team).
14. Everything at the school's bookstore is overpriced
	1. Don't buy from them, bankrupt them, force them to lower prices. Do this by buying off Amazon.
15. The school's dining hall food is overpriced and not great. 
	1. Complain on social media or news how the school forces housing students to buy dining dollars. If it gains publicity, the school might change in order to keep their profits from incoming students high.
16. The world cannot sustain the eating habits of the United States.
	1. Teach people how to cook for themselves so they may learn how to cook legume or paneer heavy diets for cheaper and more resourceful diets.
17. The United States' children are suffering from chronic illnesses from a young age.
	1. Publicly denounce the issues that processed foods are having on our children's health. Teach them how to cook for themselves and avoid products high in pesticides (many of which are banned in Europe).
18. Kids all over the world are suffering from myopia.
	1. Myopia can be reversed, however most optometrists believe that it is irreversible. It is especially easy to reverse at a younger age when the prescription is still low via a method called plus lens therapy. Greed has caused it to be silenced, but anyone can find it on the internet if they look hard enough.
19. Americans seem to be in a crises of loneliness and meaninglessness.
	1. There are not many strong leaders in US politics which awaken the spirit of the people. People need a reason to know why they are doing their jobs and they need a leader who is firm in their morals and will remind people of the meaning of their lives. Furthermore, the curriculum of the schools has failed the people. Philosophy or similar classes should be taught in all schools simply to train young people to ask deep questions about life. Instead, digital media has taken the place of deep questions which has lead to shallow connections, high suicide rates, and depression.
20. UCSD is known as UC socially dead. 
	1. The university should make a greek row, given all of its funding for new buildings already.
21. Nobody stays on campus during the weekends. 
	1. The university should make a lot of rent-able hangout places for orgs to host parties.
22. Everybody knows that the government is corrupt due to company bribes.
	1. We need mass rebellions eventually to change this\
23. Everyone hates Khosla for cancelling Sun God, one of the only events that makes it not socially dead.
	1. Hire someone else.
24. Many instructors do not care about the education of students
	1. The university should actively be teaching ways for students to teach themselves content.
25. Android is discriminated against simply because their text messages are displayed differently than Apple's.
	1. This is an easy anti-monopoly fix. Force Apple to treat text messages equally with the Linux based Android systems.
26. My toilet gets clogged often
	1. Flush for longer
27. My door hinges are too loud
	1. Add wd40
28. My lamp light if flickering
	1. Replace the bulb
29. My water is tasting weird
	1. Replace britta filter
30. I don't want to wake up when my alarm goes off
	1. Have hotsauce shots bye the bed
31. My food tastes terrible because I eat legume stew all day
	1. Add more seasoning
32. The quality of Cheddies is going down
	1. Create my own cracker company and undercut them by 10 cents a box
33. 

1-13
1. Control over the nanoscale is governed by top-down processes, excluding DNA programming.
	1. Develop voltage controlled molecular structures.
2. My knowledge of chemical reactions is not good enough to bind nanoparticles to surfaces.
	1. Take the CHEM 41 series.
3. There are no airtags thin enough to be slapped onto my earbud charging case. 
	1. Create a flexible silicone chip and sell it for money, and then forget about worrying about your earbuds because you are so wealthy.
4. Light cannot be sorted efficiently for the use of solar panels
	1. Use GRIN lenses to sort the light into different wavelengths
5. The electrical power grid is too inefficient due to power generation and large losses in transportation
	1. Localize energy sources via thin film solar panels
6. Progress in nanoengineering is too slow because we are only focusing on materials which were theorized several decades ago.
	1. We must explore new materials rather than optimizing old ones.
7. Complicated structures, biology excluded, are too difficult to create using our current methods.
	1. We need true nanofactories rather than trying to use current methods in more novel ways.
8. Current nano-theraputics uses nanoparticles in conjunction with external light sources
	1. We need true nanorobots which can controlled to identify and kill diseases.
9. The current nanoengineering department doesn't even teach chemistry. This produces incompetent nanoengineers.
	1. They NEED to teach chemistry or REQUIRE us to take chemistry classes. Ask any student if they know the chemical reactions necessary to coat gold nanoparticles onto a primed surface.
10. The nanoengineering department barely has any nanomanufacturing classes. Just ask any student if they are capable of manufacturing any of the newest devices, they will say NO. The produces VERY incompetent nanoengineers.
	1. The nanoengineering department should require labs to be inserted into the curricula of almost all nanoengineering courses. Furthermore, the professors of such classes should dedicate their quarter to teaching the students how they make devices in their area of study. The theory the students should learn should be just as much as necessary for the students to make the devices.
11. Transistors are becoming smaller but are suffering too much heat loss and quantum tunneling.
	1. Start research on organizing single molecule transistors.
12. Metallic nanoparticles are toxic to the body
	1. Develop nanoparticles which are photoreactive to become toxic to the body via external light rays, this way they can decompose safely away from the tumor target cite.
