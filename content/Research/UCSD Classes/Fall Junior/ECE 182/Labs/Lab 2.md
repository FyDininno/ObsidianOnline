1. Part A
	1. Brewster's Angle: 56 degrees
	2. 6.843 mW transmitted
	3. 0.956 mW reflected
	4. We put a horizontal polarizer in the path of the reflected beam at the Brewster's Angle and confirmed that the light almost died down to nothing afterwards
	5. We rotated polarizer in front of the generic beam and found that its power did not change much (+-.1mW). This showed that the beam was nearly randomly polarized.
2. Part B
	1. Transmitted 3.6 mW
		1. With vert pol 3.6 uW
	2. Reflected 4.9 mW
		1. With horizontal pol 41 uW
3. Part C
	1. 110 from the vertical
	2. 104 from the vertical
	3. 98 from the vertical
