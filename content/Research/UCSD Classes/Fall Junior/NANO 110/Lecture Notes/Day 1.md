Density functional theory is the best computational model for modeling molecules. 

Silicon is used to make chips. What elements are used to make it p-type or n-type?
Phosphoros (n) and Boron (p), but these are not the only ones.

What about $ZnO$? Here is where density functional theory can help us.

Furthermore, **ceramics**:
- $CaTiO_{3}$
- $PbTiO_{3}$

DFT works best at the nano-scale. You must know the positions of the atoms and then put their positions into a position matrix.
