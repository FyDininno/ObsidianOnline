$k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
Lambda is known as the wavelength, so if you multiply $k$ by the wavelength, you get $2\pi$. This means that multiples of your wavelength correspond to full rotations in the phase. 

$p=\hbar k$

$E=mc^2$ can be derived from the above equations.
1. $e=\frac{f}{\lambda}$
2. $p=\hbar k = mc$
3. $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
4. $E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}=\frac{hck}{2\pi}=\hbar kc=mc^2$

### Density Functional Theory
$H=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\sum \frac{1}{m_{\alpha}}\nabla_{\alpha} +\dots$
The kinetic energy operator is negative because the Laplacian will cause a negative sign to fall out (if the wave function solves the Schrodinger equation).
Consists of the kinetic energies of the atoms (molecular dynamics problem) and the electrons plus the potentials stemming from nuclear electron attraction (negative sign) and electron electron repulsion (positive sign). We treat the nuclei as fixed.
