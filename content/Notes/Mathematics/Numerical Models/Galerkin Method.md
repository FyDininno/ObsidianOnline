	1. <span style="font-size:21px">Multivariable Product Rule</span>
		1. The multivariable product rule is synonymous to the single variable rule due to the derivative's linear properties.
		2. We will graphically analyze the multivariable product rule $$\nabla AB=B\nabla A+A\nabla B$$
		3. This equation essentially comes from the following observation from non-standard analysis:$$(A+d A)*(B+dB)=AB+A*dB+B*dA$$
		4. Subtracting $AB$ and then dividing by an independent infinitesimal and selecting for the standard part yields the product rule. It is then easily extendable to multiple dimensions
