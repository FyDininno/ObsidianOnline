One important equation in physical models is the Sturm-Louiville Equation: $$\frac{d}{dx} \left( p(x) \frac{dy}{dx} \right) + q(x)y = f(x)$$
This says that some weighted function $y$ plus its weighted derivative is equal to some term on the right, sometimes indicating an eigenvalue to the system.

Usually, the starting and end points for a 1D system would be x=0 and x=pi.
