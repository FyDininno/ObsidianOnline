The LCAO works because electrons are Fermions, meaning that they can interfere because they are interchangeable particles. Specifically, their wavefunctions anticommute when their positions are swapped because they are Fermions. ~This is my hypothesis from what I know. Confirmation still awaits and I would like to talk to a quantum chemist.

# A new approach

Orbital hybridization is a concept that approximates the true solution to the Shrodinger Equation. In the Shrodinger Equation, we will have a symmetric potential which changes the solutions of the electron states fundamentally. Where there was once an S and a P orbital centered as standing waves around a radially symmetric potential, now their solutions will solve a symmetric potential, and therefore should take on values which have the same symmetric as they are attracted towards the symmetrically spaced nuclei. The energies will be a mix of those in P and S, as those were the original solutions.
