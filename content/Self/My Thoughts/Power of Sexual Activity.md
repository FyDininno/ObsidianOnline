Sexual activity is something evolutionary baked into each and every one of us.

Two weekends ago, I kissed a girl for the first time. At first, it felt weird because I had never done it before, but I went along with it. She used her tongue. Now looking back at it, I think it is kind of hot.

Anyway, the point is this. I didn't even like her that much. She was pretty, but I was not completely attracted to her. After that kiss, her thought began to grow on me, until a large part of my world was about her. A large part of my thinking was about where she was and what she was doing with what other guys.

Eventually, it stirred me up too much, and I decided to end it because I knew she thought of me as a friend after I didn't go further that night. However, I will never look at sexual activity the same.
